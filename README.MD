# CassMantle

## Introduction

Inspired by **[pimantle](https://semantle.pimanrul.es/)**, but with images and powered by a ton of AI! You are required to guess the missing parts of the prompt (semi-randomly generated by a language model) given a blurred image (generated from the previously generated prompt with a diffusion model). The closer your guesses are to the actual answers, the less blurry the image gets! Prompts and images update every 15 minutes (as of now).

# Where I Can Use Help...
* Any javascript help would be appreciated, I am not the best at front end so the code for that is pretty wack.
* Prompt generation can get pretty bad, the language model used sometimes generates pretty dumb prompts, and all prompts come from a fixed number of hard coded seed prompts. Any new idea on prompt generation will be helpful.
* Currently the word selection algorithm is barely holding itself together, it often masks unimportant words for players to guess.
